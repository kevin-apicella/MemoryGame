# MemoryGame

This is an educational app made for 3rd grade elementary school students in Kobe, Japan.  It was created with pygame and packaged for distribution using pyinstaller.

This game is a memory/matching game using upper case and lower case alphabet.  A colleague challenged me to make this because he wanted to use it in his classroom.  All specifications of the game including rules, UI/UX, etc., were directed by the colleague through regular meetings and QA adjustments.  This was my second application.  

If you see the term Shinkeisuijaku, that is the term for "memory game" in Japanese.
